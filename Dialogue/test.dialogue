		Bart: I heard the mayor's team was looking for a new employee, some management role I think.
		You: You know I'm not a politics guy Bart.
		Bart: Don't reckon you'll be doin' any of it. Mayor May won't like her stuff being looked into anyways.
		Bart: Hey, you're an honest guy, they need some of those. Have a look

	You: About as good as can be expected, but the news is not good

	You: Yea, you were right. The mayor has been doing some shady stuff. She even bribed me to keep shut
	Bart: Whatcha say?
	You: No, of course not. I'm not gonna be a part of whatever shes doing.
	Bart: So you quiting?
	You: No, I don't think so.

	You: What!? That's amazingly quick. Huh I guess that means I'm jobless again
	Bart: Well not really. You know that the Californian rules of democacy say that there must always be a Mayor in a city
	You: (No it doesn't, thats the rules of a monarchy)
	Game Writer: I couldn't think of anything else so shut up nerd
	Bart: And well, who better than the person who refused a straight bribe and got May behind bars.
	You: You're kidding.
	Bart: I am certainly not. If I were you, I'd head to your Office and talk to Asi, Mr. Mayor.

	You: That won't be necessary Asi. I'm sure things can stay the way they are for a while longer. We could all use some extra income while helping the city, right?
	Asi: Understood, sir.
	You: Oh and what are those behind you?
	Asi: Oh these? They're notices informing people of a job vancancy for your previous role of data management.

	May: Tell me what brings you here
	You: Morning May, sorry about that
	You: I discovered some problems with the campaign funds. None of the numbers add up. The sum of all reported income is lesser than the funds we seem to have and the reported spending seems less than actual amount depleted.
	May: Playa, this is a complex field of work. There's some exchange of money which remains... off the books.
	You: So you admit that we receive confidential funding and that its use is not properly documented.
	May: You're new here. Not all these expenses and incomes are from corrupt reasons. Overall our pratices help our goal. It increases employee morale and allows for more, albeit secret, funding for the better of the city. I'd advise you ignore this issue and focus on the important parts of your job. After all, that's what gets you the significant pay raises.
