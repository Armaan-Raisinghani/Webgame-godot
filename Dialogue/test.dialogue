		You: You know I'm not a politics guy Bart.

	May: Tell me what brings you here
	You: Morning May, sorry about that
	You: I discovered some problems with the campaign funds. None of the numbers add up. The sum of all reported income is lesser than the funds we seem to have and the reported spending seems less than actual amount depleted.
	May: Playa, this is a complex field of work. There's some exchange of money which remains... off the books.
	You: So you admit that we receive confidential funding and that its use is not properly documented.
	May: You're new here. Not all these expenses and incomes are from corrupt reasons. Overall our pratices help our goal. It increases employee morale and allows for more, albeit secret, funding for the better of the city. I'd advise you ignore this issue and focus on the important parts of your job. After all, that's what gets you the significant pay raises.
